# JavaScript: Password Generator

In order to access sensitive data we create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords with a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters,
that provides greater security based on criteria include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters that theyâ€™ve selected. 

This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Employee will click the button to generate a password.

Employee will enter a length for the password && select password criteria. (minimum of 1 criteria is required, the more criteria selected the more secure the password will be)

Password will be written on the page and ready to use.
